## URL of Shifting Rhythms Website: shiftingrhythms.github.io

# Steps to Edit and work on Website:

## Note:
You do not actually need to Mobirise to update the website (it is a myth since the Mobirise has not been update in about 2-3 years at this point)

## Things you are going to need:
1. The Shifting Rhythms Github Account (find password and username in team Google Drive in Master Accounts document)
2. Access to your own Github 
3. HTML Edittor (does not matter which one, Adobe Dreamweaver is a good starter software if not too familiar)
4. Some kind of thing that makes you happy (because why not)

### Step 1
To start, you are going to need to download the code to your own Github, but to do that and be able to edit the website, you need to be a contributor (this is where the Shifting Rhythm Github is going to be useful). From the Shifting Rhythms account, you should add yourself as a contributor (found in Settings -> Contributors -> Invite Contributor)

### Step 2
Once you have added yourself as a contibutor, you do not need the SR Github anymore and can log into your own account to accept the invite. 

### Step 3
Now you need to download the repo to your own Github, I personally use the Github desktop app, but if you are in Ubuntu, you would follow any normal way you download the repo 

### Step 4
To make sure any edits you do happen, you need to push your code to the master branch, once you do, if there are no errors in the code, the website will automatically update after a short period of time.
